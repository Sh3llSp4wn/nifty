** Project Goals
 Nifty is an extendable template engine without scope creep. It's only goal is to create a standard directory for several project types and use a simple dictionary replacement algorithm to modify file names and simple strings within the files themselves.
 The currently supported projects are in =project_templates=
** Usage
 Usage only has two commands, =list= and =create=
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# list known templates
nifty list

# create a project from a known template
nifty create c_clang output_dir_name
#+END_SRC
*** =list=
list the currently avalible project templates
*** =create=
create a project with the first parameter as project type, and the second parameter the output directory
nifty will then begin the interview and will populate replace key fields with their values
** Extending
 There are two kinds of replacement keys that nifty supports
1. File replacement keys
   1. the format is =REPLACE_key_name=
   2. This replacement key will change a file name in the project by removing the =REPLACE_= predicate and replacing =key_name= with the user specified value
2. In-File replacement keys
   1. the format is =NIFTY_REPLACE_key_name=
   2. This replacement key will change the contents of a file in the project by removing the =NIFTY_REPLACE_= predicate and replacing =key_name= with the user specified value
 Key names themselves are specified in the =project_template/project_template_name/.nifty/nifty.json= configuration file
 The following one is the =nifty.json= from c_clang
#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "replace": {"project_name": "The project name to use for populating config files and directory names"},
  "description": "clang project using Makefile to build and unity for tests"
}
#+END_SRC
 The =replace= key in the json should be a table of type ={"key name": "key description",}= the description will be printed to the user during the interview part of project configuration
 The top level =description= is printed durring the list command
